# Tour de France
A simple energy based simulator to experimentally determine the success rate of a breakaway in the Tour de France bike race. Part of Ph11 hurdle challenge.

-------------------------
usage:
modify the experiment class to set how many trials
modify Bikerunner.java to set race parameters
modify Bike.java to set physical constraints and other environmental conditions

Maybe I'll add commandline support later, right now I have problem sets do to do.
